  <p>FADE IN:</p>
<p>INT. LORGE&rsquo;S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
<p>Lorge, a quirky and expressive woman in her late 20s, sits on her couch with her pet rock, Rocky, in her lap. She types furiously on her phone, using only emojis to communicate with Rocky.</p>
<p>LORGE: üê∂üçîüè†‚ùì</p>
<p>ROCKY: üö´üê∂üçî‚úÖ</p>
<p>Lorge nods approvingly and turns to her three friends, Gorge, Larry, and Gessica, who sit on the other side of the room.</p>
<p>LORGE: Hey guys, what do you think about throwing a party for Rocky?</p>
<p>GORGE: Uh, Lorge, your pet rock can&rsquo;t really party.</p>
<p>LARRY: Yeah, and even if he could, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d be the right crowd for him.</p>
<p>GESSICA: (smiling) But we can still celebrate Rocky&rsquo;s existence, right?</p>
<p>LORGE: (excitedly) Yes! And I already have the perfect theme. We&rsquo;re going to have a rock-themed party!</p>
<p>GORGE: (sarcastically) Oh boy, I can hardly contain my excitement.</p>
<p>LARRY: (curious) What exactly does a rock-themed party entail?</p>
<p>LORGE: (grinning) Well, we&rsquo;re going to have a rock painting station, a rock scavenger hunt, and of course, a performance by Rocky himself!</p>
<p>GESSICA: (nodding) I&rsquo;m in. Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>GORGE and LARRY look at each other, shaking their heads but smiling.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>INT. LORGE&rsquo;S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
<p>The apartment is decorated with rocks of all shapes and sizes. Gorge, Larry, and Gessica stand around awkwardly, holding drinks and trying to mingle with the other guests.</p>
<p>LORGE walks in with Rocky perched on her shoulder.</p>
<p>LORGE: (to the guests) Thank you all for coming to Rocky&rsquo;s party! He&rsquo;s so excited to be here tonight.</p>
<p>The guests stare at her in confusion.</p>
<p>LARRY: (whispering to Gorge) I knew we were in for a weird night.</p>
<p>As the night goes on, the guests start to warm up to the rock-themed party. They paint rocks, search for hidden rocks, and even cheer when Rocky &ldquo;performs&rdquo; a &ldquo;concert&rdquo; on a tiny stage made out of cardboard.</p>
<p>GESSICA: (laughing) You know, I didn&rsquo;t think this party would be fun, but I&rsquo;m actually having a great time.</p>
<p>GORGE: (smiling) Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird, but it&rsquo;s Lorge&rsquo;s thing. And at least we get to spend time with her and Rocky.</p>
<p>LARRY: (agreeing) Plus, it&rsquo;s a great conversation starter. I&rsquo;ve never talked about rocks this much in my life.</p>
<p>LORGE walks up to them, holding Rocky.</p>
<p>LORGE: (smiling) Hey guys, thanks for coming. I know it was a weird idea, but I think it turned out pretty well.</p>
<p>GESSICA: (smiling) It was definitely memorable.</p>
<p>GORGE: (nodding) And that&rsquo;s what matters.</p>
<p>LARRY: (laughing) Yeah, I&rsquo;m going to remember this party for a long time.</p>
<p>Lorge and her friends laugh and continue to enjoy the rest of the party.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
